# Active Context

## Project Overview

Jackfield Labeler is a **feature-complete desktop application** for creating and printing custom label strips for audio/video jackfields (patch panels). The application provides a professional interface for designing labels with specific dimensions and segment layouts, then outputs them as high-quality PDF files ready for printing.

## Current Development Status

The project has reached **beta completion** with all core functionality implemented and working. The application is ready for final polish and version 1.0 release.

### What's Working

- ‚úÖ Complete GUI with Designer, Settings, and Preview tabs
- ‚úÖ Full label strip design capabilities with segment customization
- ‚úÖ Professional PDF generation with intelligent rotation
- ‚úÖ Project save/load functionality with `.jlp` format
- ‚úÖ Real-time preview and PNG export
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite with good coverage

### Current Focus Areas

- üü° Final UI polish and visual improvements
- üü° Multi-page support for extra-large strips
- üü° Enhanced preview with rotation visualization
- ‚è≥ Version 1.0 release preparation
- ‚è≥ Executable distribution for all platforms

## Technical Architecture

The project follows a clean **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture**:

- **Models** (`jackfield_labeler/models/`): Data structures for label strips, segments, and settings
- **Views** (`jackfield_labeler/views/`): PyQt6-based user interface components
- **Utils** (`jackfield_labeler/utils/`): PDF generation, rendering, and project management
- **Controllers**: Logic is integrated within views using PyQt6's signal-slot mechanism

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12+** with comprehensive type hints
- **PyQt6** (‚â•6.9.0) for cross-platform GUI
- **ReportLab** (‚â•4.4.1) for professional PDF generation
- **UV** package manager for fast dependency management
- **Ruff** for code quality and formatting
- **pytest** for testing framework

## Development Workflow

- **Package Management**: Use UV for all operations (`uv add`, `uv run`, `uv sync`)
- **Application Execution**: `uv run -m jackfield_labeler`
- **Testing**: `uv run pytest` for test suite execution
- **Code Quality**: `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format`
- **Documentation**: See `docs/development.md` for detailed instructions

## Codebase Statistics

- **Main Application**: ~3,500 lines of Python code across 21 files
- **Test Suite**: ~315 lines of tests
- **Dependencies**: 3 core runtime dependencies, 9 development dependencies
- **Architecture**: Clean MVC separation with well-defined interfaces

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality

- Label strip design with customizable segments
- Real-time preview and validation
